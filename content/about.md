Hi! I'm Irene Ong and Iâ€™m pursing a Comp Rhet English degree with a Computer Science minor. While these two may seem like an unlikely pairing, they made sense to me. I came to the United States in 1998 as an enormous, chubby baby. (My parents dragged me here without asking.) I grew up with one of those classic fat desktop computers and I was a gaming maniac. I learned to code in high school and naturally, when it came time to choose my path in college, I would choose computers. Sometime between my freshman and sophomore years, I decided that I needed to learn how to write and communicate better. After an extraordinary English course involving multimodal writing projects, I learned that I didn't have to choose between two paths-- I can choose both. My goal after graduation is working as an editor or writer in the technical field.
