#### Background 

I completed this design project for a Digital Media and Technology course in Fall 2019 at Ewha Womans University. I was tasked with redesigning an app that I used frequently. I created a persona and customer journey to plan out the new design. I built a prototype using Adobe XD and Google Material assets. 

You can view the prototype at its [AdobeXD page](https://xd.adobe.com/view/a7fe0dc5-77b4-46bd-485f-cf598abaa8f6-d1cf/). The [original presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EEwt-7FzCOLKgsX7Nmx7Y_LIDi6j0OCs/view?usp=sharing) is also available for viewing.
