#### Background

I completed this translation assignment for a Literary and Media Translation class I took at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea. The commision requirements were to take a foreignization approach and maintain Korean cultural references in popular fiction. The original text comes from at short story titled "The Last Guest" by Kim Youngha. I translated the text from Korean to English.
