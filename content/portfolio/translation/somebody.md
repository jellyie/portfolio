#### Background 

I joined a translation team during the summer of 2020 to provide English subtitles for a Korean television program called "Somebody".  We operate on a two week release schedule. I am a part of the translators team where my duties include translating 30 to 45 minute segments of each episode and working with typesetters to resolve any issues. Our team has provided English subtitles for episodes 7-9 of season one and we are currently working through season two.
