#### Background 

I completed this translation assignment for a Literary and Media Translation class I took at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea. The commision was to provide a viable commercial English to Korean translation applying domesticization techniques. I translated an excerpt from the SnotGirl Comic Issue #12.
