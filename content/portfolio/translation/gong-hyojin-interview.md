#### Background

I completed this translation assignment for a Literary and Media Translation class I took at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea. This was the final project for the class. I was tasked with providing English translations and subtitles for any video clip of my choice. I learned how to use Aegisub subtitling software for this project. 

You can view the translation script and final subtitled video at this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12fSnV-pYgtS_ZdvsUM-1F4UdcKFruNRU).
