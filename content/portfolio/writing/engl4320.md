#### Background 

I created this website during Fall 2020 for Professor Baotong Guâ€™s ENGL 3120 Senior Seminar in Rhetoric and Composition course. For this project, I was given the opportunity to revise a previous project and display my competency in my aspiring career field. I chose to build a website for an instruction manual on mechanical keyboards that I created a few semesters ago. I created the original project with Photoshop. For the revised project, I built a website using Hugo and deployed it with Netlify. Below you can see the changes I made to the original project.

Changes I made:
- Added a section for benefits of building a custom mechanical keyboard (Why build one?)
- Added a section for further modifications 
- Added a soldering guide
- Separated the original steps into more logical sections 
- Revised original instructions and parts descriptions
- Made my own 3D renders of the keyboard
- Took my own photos for the modifications section

You can visit the [Irony Keys](https://ironykeys.xyz/") website to view the final product. If you wish to see the original instruction manual, see the [PDF version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qokYrIaeFH8jrCoPEyAPNZhJ0jxr_HSH/view).
