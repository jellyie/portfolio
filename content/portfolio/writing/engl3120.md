#### Background

I created this website during Spring 2020 for Professor George Pullman’s ENGL 3120 Digital Writing and Publication course. Digital writing differs significantly from traditional forms of writing. I learned how to navigate and structure content for digital landscapes. For this project, I was given the opportunity to create a website that I can use to display my portfolio. This website is aimed for the English department instructors who will evaluate my senior portfolio. I plan to adapt this website for future employers.

This project was one of my favorite projects I’ve worked on as an English major. It sits at the intersection of my two disciplines—English and Computer Science. I built this website from scratch using Bootstrap 4 and Javascript. I worked hard to incorporate interactivity for the end users, and I am proud of the look and feel of the website. I will definitely continue working on this project after the end of the semester. Mainly, I plan to migrate it to a different platform, and I am working on making the website more responsive and mobile friendly. 

This website is essentially a revision of the original website. This site now works on mobile devices and I've simplified the design for better readability and accessibility. Visit the original [website](https://nong1.gsucreate.com/).
