#### Background 

I wrote this research paper during Fall 2020 for Professor Tanya Caldwell's ENGL 4201 Special Topics Before 1800s course. For this project, I was tasked with selecting a reading we completed over the semester and writing a research paper that demonstrates my knowledge of a chosen topic related to the reading. I chose to write about Aphra Behn's Oroonoko and discuss how Behn creates a social commentary of her society by incorporating royalism, mercantilism, and slavery into the text.
