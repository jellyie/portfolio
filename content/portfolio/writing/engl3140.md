#### Background

I completed this editorial project during Spring 2019 for Professor Reiner Smolinskiâ€™s ENGL 3140 Editing for Publication course. I was tasked with transcribing a given historical piece of writing and modernizing it. Once I had a good understanding of the writing, I created a diplomatic transcription of the work, then modernized that transcription and constructed a style sheet for my modernized transcription. Through this project, I acquired an exhaustive amount of copyediting principles and publication practices. I learned what goes on in creating and using style sheets, how to write for different audiences, what copyediting involves, and surprisingly, how to do research. I am much more knowledgeable about using databases than before. More importantly, I understand how to approach the revision process and how to revise more efficiently.

In modernizing the manuscript, I decided to use footnotes to clarify information rather than completely changing the writing. I wanted to stay close to the original writing to not lose any information. I have never used footnotes before, but I was pretty proud of them. If I had more time, I would make adjustments to my style sheet, mainly transforming them into a more formal written style.
