#### Background 

I completed several reports for a Computer Organization and Programming course in Spring 2019. I worked with a group throughout the semester on programming assignments, communicated with them through Slack, and shared our work through Github. Although our roles were shuffled around for each assignment, I was tasked with a writing component each time-- whether that was compiling and consolidating the report or detailing my findings for the programming section I was assigned with.
