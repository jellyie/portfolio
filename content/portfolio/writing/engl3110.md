#### Background

I completed this marketing kit project during Fall 2018 for Professor Baotong Gu’s ENGL 3110 Technical Writing course. I was given the opportunity to work with a group to produce a technical writing document for a real client. My group decided to create a marketing kit for Lime’s Juicer program. Our marketing kit included a flyer to promote the position and an informational brochure with in-depth information on the position. I selected this piece because I got a chance to work for a real client as well as in a group setting. This project is a great example and culmination of the various technical writing and design principles I learned that semester.

We created this kit aiming for simplicity and minimalism. I believe we achieved these goals. If I had more time to work on this text, I would update the information based on the company’s changes. I would also tighten the writing in the brochure to be clearer and more concise.
